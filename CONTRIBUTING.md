# Contributing Guidelines

We greatly appreciate your interest in contributing to our project. To ensure that we maintain a high level of quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

## Target Branch

- Use the `dev` branch as your target branch when creating pull requests. This helps keep the `main` branch stable and ready for production.

## Pull Request Best Practices

- For each new feature or change you want to contribute, create a separate pull request. Avoid creating large pull requests with numerous changes. Instead, try to contribute with small, focused pieces that are easier to review and merge.

## Collaboration and Avoiding Duplicated Effort

- Before starting work on a new feature or change, consider creating a discussion or checking existing discussions to see if anyone else is already working on it. This can help prevent duplicated effort and ensure that everyone is working together effectively.
